a virtual cell model, Causal Disentangled Perturbation (CDP), which integrates causal representation with meta-learning to enable zero-shot prediction for unseen cell type populations.


use the train_rmse_new.py to train the model.

use the result_rvcse.py to calculate the results of the newly cellular perturbations.


The algorithm process is as follows:
